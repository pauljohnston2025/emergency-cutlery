🍴 Emergency Cutlery: Never Go Unfed.
Picture this: You’ve trekked 12 miles into the deep backcountry. The views are peak, your campfire is crackling, and you’ve just sat down to boil the most gourmet pouch of dehydrated beef stroganoff known to man.

You reach into your pack. You find your stove. You find your fuel. You find your headlamp.

But you didn't find the fork.

The silence of the wilderness is suddenly broken by the thought of you trying to eat creamy pasta with a tent stake. It’s undignified. It’s messy. It’s a culinary tragedy.

🛡️ Have no fear—Emergency Cutlery is here!
Turn your Garmin into a high-tech digital forge and save your meal (and your pride). Emergency Cutlery is the ultimate "better-than-nothing" survival tool for the modern hiker, office worker, or forgetful foodie.

✨ Features for the Famished:
The Digital Forge: Experience the satisfying process of "Forging" your tools in real-time. Watch as our patented* algorithm aligns pixels, sharpens virtual tines, and polishes digital silver right on your wrist.

Full Culinary Suite: Choose between a heavy-duty Knife, a precision Fork, or the reliable Spoon.

Amoled Optimized: Vivid, high-contrast graphics that make your digital silverware look good enough to lick (though, for legal reasons, please do not lick your watch screen).

The Monkey Chef: Guided by our world-renowned primate culinary expert, because if you're eating beans off a watch face, you clearly need professional help.

🥚 A Secret Ingredient?
Rumor has it that the Monkey Chef hidden a little something extra in the kitchen. Some say if you perform the right "secret handshake" with your watch buttons, you might find a hidden tool that’s a bit more... festive than a standard spoon. We can’t tell you how to find it—that would spoil the sauce—but the curious hiker is often a rewarded hiker.
